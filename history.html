    <h2 class="historyh2">WHY CHESS?</h2>
    <p class="historyparagraph">
      Chess is an endlessly beautiful game. With seemingly limitless chances, it
      is both science and art.
    </p>
    <p class="historyparagraph">
      Former world champion Garry Kasparov once called a chess game musical in
      its progression - just by learning the rules, you too can become your own
      conductor!

          Your humble author could not write <br />
          such egotistical words about himself. He will instead simply tell you
          that he was one of <br />
          two important founders to the <br />
          Highlands High School chess club. <br />
          Over the board, he has beaten masters in <br />
          blitz chess events and <br />
          considers himself an intermediate player, <br />
          though ever fascinated by the <br />
          depths of chess.
